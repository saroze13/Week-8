# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Target

Time spent: **13** hours spent in total

> Objective: Detect common vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Username Enumeration
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Vulnerabilities on Blue

Vulnerability #1: 
SQL INJECTION

![SQL Injection](https://github.com/saroze13/Week-8/blob/master/SQLi.gif)







Vulnerability #2: 
Session Hijacking or Fixation 
![Session Hijacking/Fixation](https://github.com/saroze13/Week-8/blob/master/Session%20Hijacking.gif)






## Vulnerabilities on Green

Vulnerability #1: 
Cross-Site Scripting Green Vulnerable








Vulnerability #2: 
User enumeration Green vulnerable




## Vulnerabilities on Red

Vulnerability #1
CSRF





Vulnerability #2 
Insecure Data Object Reference






##Bonus: SQLi Database infromation extraction 
Build on Objective #4 (Cross-Site Scripting). Experiment to see if you can use XSS to: direct the user to a google
